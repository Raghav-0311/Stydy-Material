# Introduction to JavaScript

- JavaScript is a scripting language that enables you to create dynamically updating content, control multimedia, animate images, and pretty much everything else. (Okay, not everything, but it is amazing what you can achieve with a few lines of JavaScript code.)
- JavaScript is one of the most popular programming languages in the world.
- We mainly use JavaScript to create - 
  - Websites
  - Web Applications
  - Server-Side Applications (using Node.js)
- but JavaScript is not limited to these things, and it can also be used to -
  - Create mobile applications (using tools like React Native)
  - Create programs for microcontrollers and the IoT (Internet of Things)
  - Create smartwatch applications.
- It can basically do anything.
- It's so popular that everything new that shows up is going to have some kind of JavaScript integration at some point.

## Features - 
- ``High Level`` - 
  - it provides abstractions that allow you to ignore the details of the machine where it's running on. 
  - It manages memory automatilly with a garbage collector, so you can focus on the code instead of managinging memory like other languages like C would need.
  - It provides many constructs which allow you to deal with highly powerful variables and objects.
- ``Dynamic`` -
  - As opposed to static programming languages, a dynamic language executes at runtime many of the things that a static language does at compile time.
  - This has pros and cons, and it gives us powerful features like ``dynamic typing``, ``late binding``, ``reflection``, ``functional programming``, ``object runtime alteration``, ``closures`` and much more.
- ``Dynamically Typed`` -
  - A variable does not enforce a type.
  - You can reassign any type to a variable, for example, assigning an integer to a variable that holds a string.
- ``Loosely Typed`` - 
  - As opposed to strong typing, Loosely or Weakly typed languages do not enforce the type of an object, allowing more flexibility but denying us type safety and type checking (something that TypeScript - which builds on top of JavaScript - provides).
- ``Interpreted`` - 
  - It's commonly known as an interpreted language, which means that it does not need a compilation stage before a program can run, as opposed to C, Java or Go for example.
  - In practice, browsers do compile JavaScript before executing it, for performance reasons, but this is transparent to you: there is no additional step involved.
- ``Multi-paradigm`` - 
  - The language does not enforce any particular programming paradigm, unlike Java for example, which forces the use of object-oriented programming, or C which forces imperative programming.
  - You can write JavaScript using an object-oriented paradigm, using prototypes and the new (as of ES6) classes syntax.
  - You can write JavaScript in a functional programming style, with its first-class functions, or even in an imperative style (C-Like).
