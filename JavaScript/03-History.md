# History of JavaScript -

- JavaScript was ``created in 1995 by Brendan Eich``.
- JavaScript was ``developed for Netscape 2``.
- JavaScript has gone a very long way since its humble beginnings.
- JavaScript was the ``first scripting language`` that was supported natively by web browsers, and thanks to this it gained a competitive advantage over any other language and today it's still the only scripting language that we can use to build web applications.
- In the beginning, JavaScript was not nearly powerful as it is today, and it was mainly used for fancy animations and the marvel ``known at the time as Dynamic HTML``.
- With the growing needs that the web platform demanded (and continues to demand), JavaScript had the responsibility to grow as well, to accommodate the needs of one of the most widely used ecosystems of the world.
- In 1996, Netscape and Brendan Eich ``took JavaScript to the ECMA international standards organization``, and a technical committee ``(TC39) was created`` to develop the language.
-  JavaScript became an ``ECMA-262 standard in 1997``.
