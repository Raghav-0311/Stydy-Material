# History of Web API -
Web APIs have a history closely tied to the evolution of the internet and the technologies that power it.
- **Early Days of Web (1990s)** :
  - The World Wide Web became publicly available in the early 1990s.
  - Initially, it primarily consisted of static HTML pages.
  - As websites evolved, developers began to look for ways to make dynamic requests to servers without required a full page reload.
  - This led to the creation of technologies like CGI (Common Gateway Interface) and FastCGI, which allowed for server-side scripting and dynamic content generation.
- **SOAP (Late 1990s - Early 2000s)** :
  - SOAP stands for ``Simple Object Access Protocol``.
  - In the late 1990s, SOAP was introduced as a protocol for exchanging structured information in the implementation of web services.
  - SOAP allowed for remote procedure calls and communication between distributed systems using XML as the message format.
  - It was complex and required a significant amount of overhead.
  - Enterprises started using SOAP-based web services for integration between systems.
- **REST (Early 2000s)** :
  - REST stands for ``Representational State Transfer``.
  - **Roy Fielding** introduced the REST architectural style in his doctoral dissertation in 2000.
  - REST emphasized simplicity, scalability, and stateless client-server model.
  - The principles of REST gained popularity as an alternative to SOAP-based services due to their simplicity and ease of use.
- **Web 2.0 and Social Media APIs (Mid 2000s)** :
  - The rise of Web 2.0 brought about the concept of user-generated content and interactive web applications.
  - Companies like Google, Twitter, and Facebook began providing public APIs that allowed developers to access their platforms' data and functionality. These APIs played a crucial role in the growth of third-party applications and services.
- **JSON and Lightweight APIs (Late 2000s - Early 2010s)** :
  - JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) gained popularity as a lightweight data interchange format, replacing XML in many cases.
  - RESTful APIs started using JSON for data representation, leading to faster and more efficient communication between clients and servers.
- **API Economy and Microservices (2010s)** :
  - The concept of an "API Economy" emerged, highlighting the value of APIs as a business strategy for creating new revenue streams and fostering innovation.
  - Microservices architecture gained traction, where applications are built as a collection of small, loosely coupled services, each exposing its own API.
- **GraphQL and Continued API Evolution (2010s - Present)** :
  - GraphQL, introduced by Facebook in 2015, offered an alternative to traditional REST APIs.
  - It allows clients to request exactly the data they need, reducing over-fetching and under-fetching of data.
  - The evolution of APIs continues, with a focus on security, scalability, performance, and developer experience.
