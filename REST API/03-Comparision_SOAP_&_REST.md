# Comparision between SOAP and REST -

SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) and REST (Representational State Transfer) are two different approaches for building web services.

|Feature |SOAP |REST|
|--------|-----|----|
|**Protocol and Message Format** |Uses a strict XML-based messaging protocol. The data is encapsulated in XML format, and it often requires complex XML schemas for data validation.| Uses a vaiety of data formats, with JSON being the most popular. It's more flexible in terms of data representation and can also use XML or other formats.|
|**Communication Style** |Supports remote procedure calls (RPC) and follows a more rigid and formal communication style.| Follows a stateless client-server interaction model, where clients send requests to resources on the server. It's more relaxed and relies on the use of standard HTTP methods.|
|**Protocol Layer** |Operates at the application layer of the OSI model. | Leverages the existing application layer protocols, primarily HTTP. |
|**Security** |Supports a wide range of security features such as WS-Security for message-level security and WS-Trust for token based authentication. | Relies on the underlying transport security (HTTPS) and can also use OAth for authentication and authorization.|
|**Flexibility** | Offers more built-in features and specifications, making it suitable for enterprise-level applications where formal contracts and strict security are important. | Provides flexibility and simplicity, making it suitable for a wider range of applications and lightweight integrations.|
|**Performance** | Generally has more overhead due to its XML-based nature and additional layer of protocol and security.| Tends to have better performance, especially when using lightweight formats like JSON and when cached resources are utilized.|
|**Error Handling** | Defines its own error handling through standardized fault elements in the XML response. | Uses standard HTTP status codes to include success or failure. Error details can be included in the response body.|
|**Integration Ease** | Requires strict adherence to the specification and often involves generating code based on WSDL (Web Services Description Language) definitions.| Is more intuitive and can be accessed using HTTP clients, making it easier to integrate into different platforms and programming languages. |
|**Caching** |Doesn't have built-in caching mechanisms. | Can take advantage of caching using standard HTTP caching mechanisms. |

> In summary, SOAP is more suitable for enterprise-level applications with strict security and formal contracts, while REST offers simplicity, flexibility, and better performance, making it a preferred choice for a wide range of applications, espacially those on the web.
